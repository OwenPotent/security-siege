# Discord Bot Template

## About

This is a template for a discord bot. It is written in Typescript and uses the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) library. I wanted to create a template that was easy to use and easy to understand. I also wanted to make it easy to add new commands and events. I hope you find this template useful. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me on discord: `@OwenBellowen#1710`.
